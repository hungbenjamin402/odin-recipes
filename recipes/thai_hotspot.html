    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Hot pot is a delightful communal meal featuring a simmering pot of broth
      placed in the center of the table, surrounded by an array of raw and
      cooked ingredients for guests to cook themselves. Each guest dips their
      choice of bite-sized vegetables and thinly sliced meats into the steaming
      broth, which enhances in flavor as the meal progresses. As the broth
      simmers and cooks down, it becomes richer, and towards the end of the
      meal, it is often ladled over noodles or rice to create a flavorful soup.
      Ideal for entertaining, hot pot allows guests to enjoy precisely what they
      want while the host is celebrated for the impressive and indulgent spread.
      It's also a perfect dish for warming up on a chilly day.
