    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Scrambled eggs are a classic, simple dish made by whisking eggs and then
      cooking them gently in a pan over medium-low heat. The eggs are stirred
      constantly with a spatula or spoon to create small, soft curds, resulting
      in a fluffy and creamy texture. Often, a bit of butter or oil is added to
      the pan for richness and to prevent sticking, and a dash of salt and
      pepper enhances the flavor. Scrambled eggs can be enjoyed plain or with
      added ingredients like cheese, herbs, vegetables, or meats for extra
      flavor and texture. They're often served as a breakfast staple but can be
      enjoyed any time of the day.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: grated cheese, chopped herbs, diced vegetables, cooked meats</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them until the yolks and whites are fully combined.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the eggs and whisk again to incorporate the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and add a small amount of butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Once the butter has melted and is slightly bubbly, pour the whisked eggs into the skillet.</li>
        <li>Let the eggs sit undisturbed for a few seconds, then gently stir with a spatula to form soft curds.</li>
        <li>Continue to stir and fold the eggs until they reach your desired consistencyâ€”soft and creamy or slightly firmer.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat slightly before the eggs are fully set, as they will continue to cook from residual heat.</li>
        <li>Serve the scrambled eggs immediately while hot, optionally garnished with fresh herbs, cheese, or additional seasoning.</li>
    </ol>
